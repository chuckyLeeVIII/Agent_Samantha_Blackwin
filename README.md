# Agent_Samantha_Blackwin

Samantha Blackwin is an OPSEC-focused personal agent framework. The goal is to run entirely offline using local models and tooling. Below are some pointers for setting up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant with a British voice and optional video responses.

## 1. Qwen Uncensored RAG
- Clone `https://github.com/chuckyLeeVIII/agent-zeroRAG` and follow its setup instructions. The project uses the Qwen model to keep inference local.
- Integrate your local data sources so the assistant can answer questions with context.

## 2. Voice Synthesis
- `https://github.com/chuckyLeeVIII/Second-Me--uh-oh` provides text-to-speech tools. Configure it for a British accent to give "Samantha" a unique voice.
- The repository mentions modules such as `HTT-OPSV2` for smoothing. Review its documentation for best quality.

## 3. SurrealDB for SQL insights
- Download Surrealist from <https://surrealdb.com/surrealist> to manage and query SurrealDB.
- You can store conversation history or other structured data within SurrealDB and query it through your RAG stack.

## 4. Browser UI and Agent Workflows
- The `Second-Me--uh-oh` project includes a lightweight browser-based UI (built with R). Use it as a starting point for building out your agent workflows or "living fabric" interface.

## 5. Video Response
- For video replies, combine an open-source video generation tool with the voice synthesis setup. Generate short clips in real time to simulate a conversational avatar.

This repository only provides high-level guidance. You must clone the above projects separately and review their licenses before use.
